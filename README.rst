GitHub
------

The current version of the ``master*`` branches in the Github
repository are bleeding-edge, but they are *working* versions that
passed the tests for all versions of Python starting at 2.4.

The ``master`` branch is for Python 2.7+ (including Python 3+ through
``2to3``), while the ``master_python2.3`` branch is for Python 2.3 to
2.6 (with unit tests only run with Python 2.6).

Other branches might be present in the GitHub repository, but they are
temporary and represent work in progress that does not necessarily run
properly yet.
