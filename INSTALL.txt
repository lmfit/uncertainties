* Some installation methods:

  python setup.py install

or, for an installation in the user Python library (no additional access
rights needed):

  python setup.py install --user

or, for an installation in a custom directory my_directory:

  python setup.py install --install-lib my_directory

or, if additional access rights are needed (Unix):

  sudo python setup.py install

You can also simply move the uncertainties/ or uncertainties-py*/
directory to a location that Python can import from (directory in
which scripts using uncertainties are run, etc.), and then rename it
uncertainties/ if necessary (with no Python version number). In this
case, if the Python 3 version is needed instead, the command

  2to3 -w .

must be run inside the uncertainties/ directory, so as to convert the
Python 2 version to the Python 3 version.

* The tests programs (test_*.py) are meant to be run through the pytest
testing framework.  This can be achieved for instance with a command
like

  pytest -sv uncertainties/

or simply

  pytest uncertainties/

(for a less verbose output).
