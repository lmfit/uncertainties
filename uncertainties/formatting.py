    """
    Return a formatted number with uncertainty.

    Null errors (error_main) are displayed as the integer 0, with
    no decimal point.

    The formatting can be customized globally through the PM_SYMBOLS,
    MULT_SYMBOLS, GROUP_SYMBOLS and EXP_PRINT dictionaries, which contain
    respectively the symbol for ±, for multiplication, for parentheses, and a
    function that maps an exponent to something like "×10²" (using
    MULT_SYMBOLS).

    Each of these dictionary has (at least) a 'pretty-print' and a 'latex' key,
    that define the symbols to be used for these two output formats (the
    PM_SYMBOLS and GROUP_SYMBOLS also have a 'default' key for the default
    output format). For example, the defaults for the 'pretty-print' format
    are:

    - PM_SYMBOLS['pretty-print'] = '±'
    - MULT_SYMBOLS['pretty-print'] = '×'
    - GROUP_SYMBOLS['pretty-print'] = ( '(', ')' )
    - EXP_PRINT['pretty-print']: see the source code.

    Arguments:

    nom_val_main, error_main -- nominal value and error, before using
    common_exp (e.g., "1.23e2" would have a main value of 1.23;
    similarly, "12.3+/-0.01" would have a main value of 12.3).

    common_exp -- common exponent to use. If None, no common exponent
    is used.

    fmt_parts -- mapping that contains at least the following parts of
    the format specification: fill, align, sign, zero, width, comma,
    type; the value are strings. These format specification parts are
    handled. The width is applied to each value, or, if the shorthand
    notation is used, globally. If the error is special (zero, NaN, inf),
    the parts are applied as much as possible to the nominal value.

    prec -- precision to use with the main_pres_type format type
    (see below).

    main_pres_type -- format presentation type, either "f" or
    "F". This defines how the mantissas, exponents and NaN/inf values are
    represented (in the same way as for float). None, the empty
    string, or "%" are not accepted.

    options -- options (as an object that support membership testing, like for
    instance a string). "P" is for pretty-printing ("±" between the nominal
    value and the error, superscript exponents, etc.). "L" is for a LaTeX
    output. "S" is for the shorthand notation 1.23(1). "p" is for making sure
    that the …±… part is surrounded by parentheses.  "%" adds a final percent
    sign, and parentheses if the shorthand notation is not used. Options can
    be combined. The P option has priority over the L option (if both are
    given). For details, see the documentation for
    AffineScalarFunction.__format__().

    # give "000.". Another example is '{:<4.0f}'.format(0.1), which

    # implement in the general case, because no format prints "0."

    # integer zero, after rounding. The problem is not larger, for

    #

def format_ufloat(ufloat_to_format, format_spec):
    """
    Formats a number with uncertainty.

    The format specification are the same as for format() for
    floats, as defined for Python 2.6+ (restricted to what the %
    operator accepts, if using an earlier version of Python),
    except that the n presentation type is not supported. In
    particular, the usual precision, alignment, sign flag,
    etc. can be used. The behavior of the various presentation
    types (e, f, g, none, etc.) is similar. Moreover, the format
    is extended: the number of digits of the uncertainty can be
    controlled, as is the way the uncertainty is indicated (with
    +/- or with the short-hand notation 3.14(1), in LaTeX or with
    a simple text string,...).

    Beyond the use of options at the end of the format
    specification, the main difference with floats is that a "u"
    just before the presentation type (f, e, g, none, etc.)
    activates the "uncertainty control" mode (e.g.: ".6u").  This
    mode is also activated when not using any explicit precision
    (e.g.: "g", "10f", "+010,e" format specifications).  If the
    uncertainty does not have a meaningful number of significant
    digits (0 and NaN uncertainties), this mode is automatically
    deactivated.

    The nominal value and the uncertainty always use the same
    precision. This implies trailing zeros, in general, even with
    the g format type (contrary to the float case). However, when
    the number of significant digits of the uncertainty is not
    defined (zero or NaN uncertainty), it has no precision, so
    there is no matching. In this case, the original format
    specification is used for the nominal value (any "u" is
    ignored).

    Any precision (".p", where p is a number) is interpreted (if
    meaningful), in the uncertainty control mode, as indicating
    the number p of significant digits of the displayed
    uncertainty. Example: .1uf will return a string with one
    significant digit in the uncertainty (and no exponent).

    If no precision is given, the rounding rules from the
    Particle Data Group are used, if possible
    (http://pdg.lbl.gov/2010/reviews/rpp2010-rev-rpp-intro.pdf). For
    example, the "f" format specification generally does not use
    the default 6 digits after the decimal point, but applies the
    PDG rules.

    A common exponent is used if an exponent is needed for the
    larger of the nominal value (in absolute value) and the
    standard deviation, unless this would result in a zero
    uncertainty being represented as 0e... or a NaN uncertainty as
    NaNe.... Thanks to this common exponent, the quantity that
    best describes the associated probability distribution has a
    mantissa in the usual 1-10 range. The common exponent is
    factored (as in "(1.2+/-0.1)e-5"). unless the format
    specification contains an explicit width (" 1.2e-5+/- 0.1e-5")
    (this allows numbers to be in a single column, when printing
    numbers over many lines). Specifying a minimum width of 1 is a
    way of forcing any common exponent to not be factored out.

    The fill, align, zero and width parameters of the format
    specification are applied individually to each of the nominal
    value and standard deviation or, if the shorthand notation is
    used, globally.

    The sign parameter of the format specification is only applied
    to the nominal value (since the standard deviation is
    positive).

    In the case of a non-LaTeX output, the returned string can
    normally be parsed back with ufloat_fromstr(). This however
    excludes cases where numbers use the "," thousands separator,
    for example.

    Options can be added, at the end of the format
    specification. Multiple options can be specified:

    - When "P" is present, the pretty-printing mode is activated: "±"
      separates the nominal value from the standard deviation, exponents
      use superscript characters, etc.
    - When "S" is present (like in .1uS), the short-hand notation 1.234(5)
      is used, indicating an uncertainty on the last digits; if the digits
      of the uncertainty straddle the decimal point, it uses a fixed-point
      notation, like in 12.3(4.5).
    - When "L" is present, the output is formatted with LaTeX.
    - "p" ensures that there are parentheses around the …±… part (no
      parentheses are added if some are already present, for instance
      because of an exponent or of a trailing % sign, etc.). This produces
      outputs like (1.0±0.2) or (1.0±0.2)e7, which can be useful for
      removing any ambiguity if physical units are added after the printed
      number.

    An uncertainty which is exactly zero is represented as the
    integer 0 (i.e. with no decimal point).

    The "%" format type forces the percent sign to be at the end
    of the returned string (it is not attached to each of the
    nominal value and the standard deviation).

    Some details of the formatting can be customized as described
    in format_num().
