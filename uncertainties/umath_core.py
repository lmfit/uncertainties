# We wrap the functions from the math module so that they keep track of
# uncertainties by returning a AffineScalarFunc object.

# Some functions from the math module cannot be adapted in a standard
# way so to work with AffineScalarFunc objects (either as their result
# or as their arguments):

# (1) Some functions return a result of a type whose value and
# variations (uncertainties) cannot be represented by AffineScalarFunc
# (e.g., math.frexp, which returns a tuple).  The exception raised
# when not wrapping them with wrap() is more obvious than the
# one obtained when wrapping them (in fact, the wrapped functions
# attempts operations that are not supported, such as calculation a
# subtraction on a result of type tuple).

# (2) Some functions don't take continuous scalar arguments (which can
# be varied during differentiation): math.fsum, math.factorial...
# Such functions can either be:

# - wrapped in a special way.

# - excluded from standard wrapping by adding their name to
# no_std_wrapping

# Math functions that have a standard interface: they take
# one or more float arguments, and return a scalar:

# for floats is preserved, as users should not care about deviations
