    The function f must return a float or integer value.  The returned

    Arguments:
    ----------
    derivatives_args: list or iterable
           list or tupleof derivative functionss or None with respect to
           the positional arguments of `f`.  See Note 1.
    derivatives_kwargs: dictionary
           dict of derivative functionss or None with respect to the
           keyword arguments of `f`.  See Note 1.

    Notes:
    -------
    1.  Each function must be the partial derivative of f with respect to the
        corresponding positional parameters, and must have the same signature
        as ``f``. `derivative_args` hold derivitative functions for positional
        arguments (include `*varargs`), while  `derivative_kwargs` holds
        derivitative functions for keyword arguments (include `**kwargs`). If an
        entry is `None` or not supplied, and if the argument value isa numeric
        Variable, a numerical derivative will be used. Non-numeric are ignored.
    2.  If derivatives are meaningless or the function is not function is not
        differentiable, the derivative funcion should return NaN for values
        for which the the function is not differentiable.

    Example:
    --------
    To wrap `sin`, one could do
       >>> from uncertainties import wrap, umath
       >>> import math
       >>> usin_a = wrap(math.sin)   # uses numerical derivative
       >>> usin_b = wrap(math.sin, [math.cos])  # use analytic derivative
       >>> usin_c = umath.sin        # builtin, same as usin_2
