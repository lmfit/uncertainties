Older Version history
------------------------

Main changes:
- 3.1.6: The pretty-print and LaTeX format can now be customized.
- 3.1.5: Added a "p" formatting option, that makes sure that there are always
  parentheses around the … ± … part of printed numbers.
- 3.1.4: Python 2.7+ is now required.
- 3.1.2: Fix for NumPy 1.17 and ``unumpy.ulinalg.pinv()``.
- 3.1: Variables built through a correlation or covariance matrix, and that
  have uncertainties that span many orders of magnitude are now
  calculated more accurately (improved ``correlated_values()`` and
  ``correlated_values_norm()`` functions).
- 3.0: Massive speedup for some operations involving large numbers of numbers with uncertainty, like ``sum(ufloat(1, 1) for _ in xrange(100000))`` (this is about 5,000 times faster than before).
- 2.4.8: Friendlier completions in Python shells, etc.: internal functions should not appear anymore (for the user modules: ``uncertainties``, ``uncertainties.umath`` and  ``uncertainties.unumpy``). Parsing the shorthand notation (e.g. ``3.1(2)``) now works with infinite values (e.g. ``-inf(inf)``); this mirrors the ability to print such numbers with uncertainty. The Particle Data Group rounding rule is applied in more cases (e.g. printing 724.2±26.2 now gives ``724±26``). The shorthand+LaTeX formatting of numbers with an infinite nominal value is fixed. ``uncertainties.unumpy.matrix`` now uses ``.std_devs`` instead of ``.std_devs()``, for consistency with floats with uncertainty (automatic conversion of code added to ``uncertainties.1to2``).
- 2.4.7: String formatting now works for ``(-)inf+/-...`` numbers.
- 2.4.5: String formatting now works for ``NaN+/-...`` numbers.
- 2.4.4: The documentation license now allows its commercial use.
- 2.4.2: `NumPy 1.8 compatibility <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/4063>`_.
- 2.4.1: In ``uncertainties.umath``, functions ``ceil()``, ``floor()``,
  ``isinf()``, ``isnan()`` and ``trunc()`` now return values of
  the same type as the corresponding ``math`` module function
  (instead of generally returning a value with a zero uncertainty
  ``...+/-0``).
- 2.4: Extensive support for the formatting_ of numbers with uncertainties.
  A zero uncertainty is now explicitly displayed as the integer 0.
  The new formats are generally understood by ``ufloat_fromstr()``.
  Abbreviations for the nominal value (``n``) and the standard
  deviation (``s``) are now available.
- 2.3.6:  Full support for limit cases of the power operator
  ``umath.pow()``.
- 2.3.5: Uncertainties and derivatives can now be NaN (not-a-number).
  Full support for numbers with a zero uncertainty
  (``sqrt(ufloat(0, 0))`` now works).
  Full support for limit cases of the power operator (``x**y``).
- 2.3: Functions wrapped
  so that they accept numbers with uncertainties instead of floats
  now have full keyword arguments support
  (improved ``wrap()`` function). Incompatible change:
  ``wrap(..., None)`` should be replaced by ``wrap(...)`` or
  ``wrap(..., [])``.
- 2.2: Creating arrays and matrices of numbers with uncertainties
  with ``uarray()`` and ``umatrix()`` now requires two simple arguments
  (nominal values and standard deviations) instead of a tuple argument.
  This is consistent with the new, simpler ``ufloat()`` interface.
  The previous
  usage will be supported for some time. Users are encouraged to update
  their code, for instance through the newly provided `code updater`_,
  which in addition now automatically converts ``.set_std_dev(v)`` to
  ``.std_dev = v``.
- 2.1: Numbers with uncertainties are now created more directly like
  ``ufloat(3, 0.1)``, ``ufloat(3, 0.1, "pi")``,
  ``ufloat_fromstr("3.0(1)")``, or ``ufloat_fromstr("3.0(1)", "pi")``.
  The previous ``ufloat((3, 0.1))`` and ``ufloat("3.0(1)")`` forms
  will be supported for some time. Users are encouraged to update
  their code, for instance through the newly provided `code updater`_.
- 2.0: The standard deviation is now obtained more directly without an
  explicit
  call (``x.std_dev`` instead of ``x.std_dev()``). ``x.std_dev()``
  will be supported for some time. Users are encouraged to update
  their code. The standard deviation of a variable can now be
  directly updated with ``x.std_dev = 0.1``. As a consequence,
  ``x.set_std_dev()`` is deprecated.
- 1.9.1: Support added for pickling subclasses of ``UFloat`` (= ``Variable``).
- 1.9: Added functions for handling correlation matrices:
  ``correlation_matrix()`` and
  ``correlated_values_norm()``. (These new functions mirror the
  covariance-matrix based ``covariance_matrix()`` and
  ``correlated_values()``.) ``UFloat.position_in_sigmas()`` is
  now named ``UFloat.std_score()``, so as to follow the common
  naming convention (`standard score
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score>`_).  Obsolete
  functions were removed (from the main module:
  ``NumberWithUncert``, ``num_with_uncert``, ``array_u``,
  ``nominal_values``, ``std_devs``).
- 1.8: Compatibility with Python 3.2 added.
- 1.7.2: Compatibility with Python 2.3, Python 2.4, Jython 2.5.1 and
  Jython 2.5.2 added.
- 1.7.1: New semantics: ``ufloat("12.3(78)")`` now represents 12.3+/-7.8
  instead of 12.3+/-78.
- 1.7: ``ufloat()`` now raises ValueError instead of a generic Exception,
  when given an incorrect
  string representation, like ``float()`` does.
- 1.6: Testing whether an object is a number with uncertainty should now
  be done with ``isinstance(..., UFloat)``.
  ``AffineScalarFunc`` is not imported by ``from uncertainties import *``
  anymore, but its new alias ``UFloat`` is.
- 1.5.5: The first possible license is now the Revised BSD License
  instead of GPLv2, which
  makes it easier to include this package in other projects.
- 1.5.4.2: Added ``umath.modf()`` and ``umath.frexp()``.
- 1.5.4: ``ufloat`` does not accept a single number (nominal value) anymore.
  This removes some potential confusion about
  ``ufloat(1.1)`` (zero uncertainty) being different from
  ``ufloat("1.1")`` (uncertainty of 1 on the last digit).
- 1.5.2: ``float_u``, ``array_u`` and ``matrix_u`` renamed ``ufloat``,
  ``uarray`` and ``umatrix``, for ease of typing.
- 1.5:  Added functions ``nominal_value`` and ``std_dev``, and
  modules ``unumpy`` (additional support for NumPy arrays and
  matrices) and ``unumpy.ulinalg`` (generalization of some
  functions from ``numpy.linalg``).
  Memory footprint of arrays of numbers with uncertainties
  divided by 3.
  Function ``array_u`` is 5 times faster.
  Main function ``num_with_uncert`` renamed
  ``float_u``, for consistency with ``unumpy.array_u`` and
  ``unumpy.matrix_u``, with the added benefit of a shorter name.
- 1.4.5: Added support for the standard ``pickle`` module.
- 1.4.2: Added support for the standard ``copy`` module.
- 1.4: Added utilities for manipulating NumPy arrays of numbers with
  uncertainties (``array_u``, ``nominal_values`` and ``std_devs``).
- 1.3: Numbers with uncertainties are now constructed with
  ``num_with_uncert()``, which replaces ``NumberWithUncert()``.  This
  simplifies the class hierarchy by removing the ``NumberWithUncert`` class.
- 1.2.5: Numbers with uncertainties can now be entered as
  ``NumberWithUncert("1.23+/-0.45")`` too.
- 1.2.3: ``log(x, base)`` is now supported by ``umath.log()``, in addition
  to ``log(x)``.
- 1.2.2: Values with uncertainties are now output like 3+/-1, in order
  to avoid confusing 3+-1 with 3+(-1).
- 1.2: A new function, ``wrap()``, is exposed, which allows non-Python
  functions (e.g. Fortran or C used through a module such as SciPy) to
  handle numbers with uncertainties.
- 1.1: Mathematical functions (such as cosine, etc.) are in a new
  uncertainties.umath module;
  they do not override functions from the ``math`` module anymore.
- 1.0.12: Main class (``Number_with_uncert``) renamed ``NumberWithUncert``
  so as to follow `PEP 8`_.
- 1.0.11: ``origin_value`` renamed more appropriately as
  ``nominal_value``.
- 1.0.9: ``correlations()`` renamed more appropriately as
  ``covariance_matrix()``.
